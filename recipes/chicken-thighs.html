        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sticky and Easy Honey Garlic Chicken made fast and simple, with the most amazing <strong>5-ingredient honey garlic sauce</strong> that is so good you will want to use it on everything!</p>
        <p>This super-simple recipe makes a crisp-tender chicken with a perfect, sticky glaze. <em>You may (or may not) remember the crispy oven fried chicken I made a couple months ago?</em> Well, this sauce was so good on those chicken pieces, that I wondered what would happen if I cooked some pieces right in the sauce without any crumbing or breading needed
        </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>6 chicken thighs, bone in or out, with or without skin*</li>
          <li>Salt and pepper, to season</li>
          <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder, to season</li>
          <li> 6 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
          <li> 1/3 cup honey</li>
          <li>1/4 cup water (or chicken broth)</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons rice wine vinegar (or apple cider vinegar, or any white vinegar)</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Season chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder; set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat a pan or skillet over medium high heat; sear chicken thigh fillets or breast fillets on both sides until golden and cooked through.</li>
            <li>When chicken is done and cooked through, arrange chicken skin-side up in the pan (if cooking with skin); add the garlic between the chicken and fry until fragrant (about 30 seconds). Add the honey, water, vinegar and soy sauce. Increase heat to medium-high and continue to cook until the sauce reduces down and thicken slightly (about 3-4 minutes).</li>
            <li>Garnish with parsley and serve over vegetables, rice, pasta or with a salad.</li>
